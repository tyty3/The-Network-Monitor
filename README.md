Network Monitor - PowerShell Ping Script

The Network Monitor is a simple PowerShell Ping Script that acts as a Network Monitoring Tool. That imports a CSV file which contains a list IP address and the names of the devices you would like to monitor. The script runs every 60 seconds, importing the list and testing the connection of every device to ensure it is online. Alerting you to any devices which are unavailable.
